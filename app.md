The **Science Pulse** is a free tool designed to bridge the gap between the discussions of journalists and scientists within social media platforms.

As a data exploratory tool, it is better suited to work on desktop computers, but it also works on mobile. If you have any feedback or experience any problems using this tool, reach us at [sciencemonitor@icfj.org](mailto:sciencemonitor@icfj.org).
