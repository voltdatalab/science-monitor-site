As a data exploratory tool, it is better suited to work on desktop computers, but it also works on mobile. For now, we have only data from Twitter, but we are working to get access to data to create other modules, especially one for Facebook.
<br /><br />
We would really appreciate any feedback or comments about your experience using this tool, it can help us make a better resource for all. The best way for that is through <a href="https://forms.gle/gtc9YBH8cHFw8ACJA" target="_blank">this short, six-question form</a>.
<br /><br />
To suggest a new profile to be included in our platform, use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGk8fYdAtAcyMuddZHqJDHYuTYn0o6i5dSrPzB__0HeggLhQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>.

<h2 id="methodology">METHODOLOGY</h2>
<h4 id="profile-collection">PROFILE COLLECTION</h4>
<p>All the profiles of scientists, experts, physicians, organisations and scientific initiatives were compiled by Pulse&#39;s development team through a number of methods, and where based on the biographies displayed in their profiles at the time of collection.</p>
<p>We found those profiles mostly through three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A crowdsourcing, where people were invited to suggest a profile;</li>
<li>By identifying users with profiles verified by Twitter and checking the profiles that they follow;</li>
<li>Consulting Twitter lists of scientists made by universities and journalists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone can suggest a new profile to include in our platform through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGk8fYdAtAcyMuddZHqJDHYuTYn0o6i5dSrPzB__0HeggLhQ/viewform">this form</a>.</p>
<h4 id="data-collection">DATA COLLECTION</h4>
<p>New posts in social media are collected constantly. People are entitled to change their minds and their position around certain topics, and, to maintain the privacy of the profiles in our database regarding older content, we only disclose up to the latest 30,000 posts published or shared by those users.</p>
<p>Our database is updated with new tweets and counts every 15 minutes, in respect to Twitters free API limits.</p>
<p>We are still working on modules to include other social media platforms.</p>
<h4 id="twitter-trends">TWITTER TRENDS</h4>
<p>All our trends consider only tweets published in the last 24-hours.</p>
<p>The hashtags trends are the count of used hashtags in tweets, grouped by language. The most those hashtgas are used in a 24h span, the higher they rank.</p>
<p>Regarding trending tweets, we created two separate groups: 1. one shows the most shared tweets published by any other profile in Twitter -- which allows us to identify how scientists engage outside the science bubble; 2. the other shows the most shared post published by one profile in Pulse&#39;s database -- which allows us to see how experts and scientists engage with each other.</p>
