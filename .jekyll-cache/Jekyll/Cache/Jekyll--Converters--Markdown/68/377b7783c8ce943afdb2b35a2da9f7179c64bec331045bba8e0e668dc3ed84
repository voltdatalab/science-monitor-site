<h3 id="profile-collection">PROFILE COLLECTION</h3>
<p>All the profiles of scientists, experts, physicians, organisations and scientific initiatives were compiled by Science Pulseâ€™s development team through a number of methods. We found those profiles mostly through three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A crowdsourcing, where people were invited to suggest a profile;</li>
  <li>By identifying users with profiles verified by Twitter and checking the profiles that they follow;</li>
  <li>Consulting Twitter lists of scientists made by universities and journalists.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone can suggest a new profile to include in our platform through <a href="https://forms.gle/KHufKHzJxJVdsD7s8">this form</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a scientist or expert with a profile mapped by this tool, you can ask us to be left out. Send an email to <a href="mailto:sciencemonitor@icfj.org">sciencemonitor@icfj.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="data-collection">DATA COLLECTION</h3>

<p>New posts in social media are collected constantly. For now, we are limiting the display of information for only 30 day-periods at a time. Our database is updated regularly with new tweets and counts, in respect to Twitterâ€™s free API limits.</p>

<p>We are still working on modules to include other social media platforms.</p>

<h3 id="twitter-trends">TWITTER TRENDS</h3>

<p>All our trends consider only tweets published in the last 12 to 24 hours by our listed profiles. They consider both authored tweets and retweets as separate posts.</p>

<p>The hashtags trends are based on the count of hashtags posted in our sample of tweets, grouped by language. The more each hashtag is used in a 12 to 24h span, the higher it ranks.</p>

<p>Trending tweets are separated into two groups for each language:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One shows the most retweeted posts published in Pulseâ€™s database by the listâ€™s own members. Every time member shared a tweet, it counts as one. The highest ranked posts had the highest number of retweets inside the sample, thus identifying the tweets that got the most attention by the listed accounts. For example, if 15 profiles in our sample shared <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1275349898209173505">this @WHO tweet</a>, it has a 15 share rate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other lists the most shared tweets considering the most recent RT counts of each. In this set, we identify those posts with wide repercussion on Twitter that were also shared by our expertsâ€™ and institutionsâ€™ list. They count retweets among the whole set of Twitter users, at the time of the most recent share by one of the accounts in our sample. For example, it considers the total RT count for <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1275349898209173505">this tweet by @WHO</a> at the time it was shared in the sample (564 RT at 5:15pm GMT -3).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
