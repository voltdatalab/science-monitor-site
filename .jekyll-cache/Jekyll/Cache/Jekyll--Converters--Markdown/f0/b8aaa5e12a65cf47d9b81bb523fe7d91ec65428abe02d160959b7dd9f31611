<h3 id="profile-collection">PROFILE COLLECTION</h3>
<p>All the profiles of scientists, experts, physicians, organisations and scientific initiatives were compiled by Pulse’s development team through a number of methods, and where based on the biographies displayed in their profiles at the time of collection.</p>

<p>We found those profiles mostly through three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A crowdsourcing, where people were invited to suggest a profile;</li>
  <li>By identifying users with profiles verified by Twitter and checking the profiles that they follow;</li>
  <li>Consulting Twitter lists of scientists made by universities and journalists.</li>
</ol>
