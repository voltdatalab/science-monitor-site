I"J<p>The <strong>Science Pulse</strong> is a free tool designed to bridge the gap between the discussions of journalists and scientists within social media platforms. As a data exploratory tool, it is better suited to work on desktop computers, but it also works on mobile.</p>

<p>For now, we have only data from Twitter, but we are working to get access to data to create other modules, especially Facebook.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback or experience any problems using this tool, reach us at <a href="mailto:sciencemonitor@icfj.org">sciencemonitor@icfj.org</a>.</p>
