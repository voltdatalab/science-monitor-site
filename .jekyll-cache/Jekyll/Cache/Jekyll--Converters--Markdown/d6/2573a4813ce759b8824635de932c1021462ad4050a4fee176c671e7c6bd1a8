## ABOUT

Scientists and journalists have a longstanding record of collaboration. But, as social media creates its own hard-to burst bubbles, sometimes a bridge is necessary to bring the two sides into the same conversation.

The **Science Pulse** wants to be that bridge. In a time where scientific knowledge is in great demand, there are also great challenges around the way academic papers and preliminary conclusions are communicated.


The **Science Pulse** is sponsored by the [International Center for Journalists](https://icfj.org/) with support from the [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/), under the [Knight Fellowship](https://www.icfj.org/our-work/knight/icfj-knight-fellowships) program, to help journalists find scientific content shared on social media, as well as become aware of the conversation within the scientific community, especially for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and desinformation.

The project is developed by the data-driven agency [Volt Data Lab](https://voltdata.info/).

## METHODOLOGY

#### PROFILE COLLECTION
All the profiles of scientists, experts, physicians, organisations and scientific initiatives were compiled by Pulse's development team through a number of methods, and where based on the biographies displayed in their profiles at the time of collection.

We found those profiles mostly through three ways:

1. A crowdsourcing, where people were invited to suggest a profile;
2. By identifying users with profiles verified by Twitter and checking the profiles that they follow;
3. Consulting Twitter lists of scientists made by universities and journalists.

<br />

#### DATA COLLECTION

New posts in social media are collected constantly. People are entitled to change their minds and their position around certain topics, and, to maintain the privacy of the profiles in our database regarding older content, we only disclose the latest 30,000 posts published or shared.

We update our database with new tweets and every 15 minutes, in respect to API limits at
