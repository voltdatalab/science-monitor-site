<p>The <strong>Science Pulse</strong> is a free tool designed to bridge the gap between the discussions of journalists and scientists within social media platforms.</p>

<p>As a data exploratory tool, it is better suited to work on desktop computers, but it also works on mobile. For now, we have only data from Twitter, but we are working to get access to data to create other modules, especially one for Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>[1]</strong> We would really appreciate any feedback or comments about your experience using this tool, it can help us make a better resource for all. The best way for that is through <a href="https://forms.gle/gtc9YBH8cHFw8ACJA">this short, six-question form</a>.</p>
