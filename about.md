### WHY IS THIS RELEVANT?

Scientists and journalists have a longstanding record of collaboration. But, as social media creates its own hard-to burst bubbles, sometimes a bridge is necessary to bring awareness about each other's conversations. Journalists can benefit a lot from knowing what scientists and experts are sharing on social media.

The **Science Pulse** wants to be that bridge. In a time where scientific knowledge is in great demand, there are also great challenges around the way academic papers and preliminary conclusions are communicated. Data, conclusions and decisions can change fast.

It is hard to keep up with all social media has to offer nowadays, and even harder to follow hundreds of new people, even if you are interested in what they have to say. And even if you do follow them, some messages will be bury amongst hundreds of other posts and trending topics.

That is why we decided to make a tool to increase the discovery around the scientific conversation on social media, especially regarding the coronavirus pandemic. It is a way to increase knowledge but also leave some noise out of social media. We will give room for people that are brilliant in their fields, but might not have thousands of followers to engage.


### ABOUT

The **Science Pulse** is sponsored by the [International Center for Journalists](https://icfj.org/) with support from the [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/), under the [Knight Fellowship](https://www.icfj.org/our-work/knight/icfj-knight-fellowships) program. The project is developed by the data-driven agency [Volt Data Lab](https://voltdata.info/), which is owned by the current fellow.

Brazilian science journalism agency [Bori](https://abori.com.br/) is our partner in this venture, helping us to make sense of the technology and the information we gathered.

### METHODOLOGY

#### PROFILE COLLECTION
All the profiles of scientists, experts, physicians, organisations and scientific initiatives were compiled by Pulse's development team through a number of methods, and where based on the biographies displayed in their profiles at the time of collection.

We found those profiles mostly through three ways:

1. A crowdsourcing, where people were invited to suggest a profile;
2. By identifying users with profiles verified by Twitter and checking the profiles that they follow;
3. Consulting Twitter lists of scientists made by universities and journalists.

Anyone can suggest a new profile to include in our platform through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGk8fYdAtAcyMuddZHqJDHYuTYn0o6i5dSrPzB__0HeggLhQ/viewform).

If you are a scientist or expert with a profile mapped by this tool, you can ask us to be left out. Send an email to [sciencemonitor@icfj.org](mailto:sciencemonitor@icfj.org).

#### DATA COLLECTION

New posts in social media are collected constantly. People are entitled to change their minds and their position around certain topics, and, to maintain the privacy of the profiles in our database regarding older content, we only disclose up to the latest 30,000 posts published or shared by those users.

Our database is updated with new tweets and counts every 15 minutes, in respect to Twitters free API limits.

We are still working on modules to include other social media platforms.

#### TWITTER TRENDS

All our trends consider only tweets published in the last 24-hours.

The hashtags trends are the count of used hashtags in tweets, grouped by language. The most those hashtgas are used in a 24h span, the higher they rank.

Regarding trending tweets, we created two separate groups: 1. one shows the most shared tweets published by any other profile in Twitter -- which allows us to identify how scientists engage outside the science bubble; 2. the other shows the most shared post published by one profile in Pulse's database -- which allows us to see how experts and scientists engage with each other.
